==Quiz
[Daniela Grossmann - Nov, 2012]
personal project during Dev Bootcamp

- a teacher initializes a quiz for a lesson subject, f.e. "The Stone Ages"
- after the lesson each student and the teacher can create one question (including multiple choice answers)
- when everyone has submitted his question, all can take the quiz.
- the quiz can only be taken once, but the student can see all questions including the correct answers.
